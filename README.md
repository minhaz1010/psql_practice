### 1. What is PostgreSQL?

PostgreSQL is a free and open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) that complies with SQL standards.

---

### 2. Database Schema

A database schema in PostgreSQL serves as a logical container for organizing database objects such as `TABLE`, `VIEW`, `FUNCTIONS`.

---

### 3. Primary and Foreign Keys

- **Primary Key**: A column or set of columns that uniquely identifies each row in a table and cannot be null.
- **Foreign Key**: A column in one table that refers to the primary key in another table. It's used to retrieve data from other tables.

---

### 4. VARCHAR vs CHAR

> CHAR stores fixed-length strings, padding with spaces if necessary. The length of CHAR must be filled.

> VARCHAR stores variable-length strings without padding.

---

### 5. WHERE Clause

The `WHERE` clause in a `SELECT` statement is used to retrieve data conditionally.

---

### 6. LIMIT and OFFSET

`LIMIT` and `OFFSET` are used for pagination. Example:

```sql
SELECT * FROM products LIMIT 10 OFFSET (10 * (page_number - 1));
```

---

### 7. UPDATE Statements

To modify data using UPDATE statements:

```sql
UPDATE table_name
SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ...
WHERE condition;
```

---

### 8. JOIN Operations

JOIN operations combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column:

- **INNER JOIN**: Returns only matching rows
- **LEFT JOIN**: Returns all rows from the left table and matched ones from the right
- **RIGHT JOIN**: Returns all rows from the right table and matched ones from the left
- **FULL JOIN**: Returns all rows when there's a match in either table, including unmatched rows from both

---

### 9. GROUP BY Clause

The GROUP BY clause arranges identical data into groups based on one or more columns. It's often used with aggregate functions like SUM, COUNT, AVG, MAX, or MIN to perform calculations on grouped data sets.

---

### 10. Aggregate Functions

- **COUNT**: Count the number of rows matching a condition
  ```sql
  SELECT COUNT(column_name) FROM table_name WHERE condition;
  ```

- **SUM**: Find the total sum of a numeric column
  ```sql
  SELECT SUM(column_name) FROM table_name WHERE condition;
  ```

- **AVG**: Calculate the average value of a numeric column
  ```sql
  SELECT AVG(column_name) FROM table_name WHERE condition;
  ```
